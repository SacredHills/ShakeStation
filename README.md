"For some reason Earthquake Markers are not showing up in the screenshots"


Android App to display Raspberry Shake Seismograph Data and USGS Earthquake Data with List and Markers on a Map.

Left Top button is for Screenshots and the Right Top button is the Settings. 

Dragable middle divider to increase size of List and Map or Seismograph and Spectrogram

Options:

*Inferno and JET Colormaps for Spectrogram

*Spectrogram Intensity Slider for Preferred Adjustment

*Timeline Length from 1 to 30 Minutes, I wouldnt recommend anything over 10 Minutes unless you have a powerful Phone or Tablet, You also need to be disconnected from the data to change the timeline length

*Option to disable Spectrogram

*Seismograph Filter from 50hz to 1hz

Fetch Raspberry Shake data on any assigned port - use datacast in your Raspberry Shake settings to set your phones IP Address and Port Number, use rs.local or IP and port to connect.

Recommended: A phone or tablet with 4gb ram and 8 core processor
